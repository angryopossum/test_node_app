The premise is simple, take the popular AL Sport and stonewash it like you would a pair of jeans. That's right, take a perfectly good pen and throw it in a giant industrial washing machine with a bunch of rocks. The result is a writing instrument that looks as though it has been well used over the years. Creating the finish in this way also means that no two pens are the same - the pen you buy will vary from the image above, perhaps by a little, maybe by a lot. This pen will arrive scratched and marked with a slightly rough feel to the finish; if you like to keep your pens pretty then this probably isn't one for you.Matt black stonewashed finish with polished stainless-steel nib.The AL Sport closely follows an original 1935 octagonal design - 'Small in the pocket, large in the hand'. The oversized cap arrangement creates a small closed pen but a full length open pen. Closed, the pen is just 108mm long, open 133mm long. The barrel is 14mm in diameter (around the cap). Pocket clips are optional, and not supplied with the pen. Made from tough, solid aluminium, weighing approx. 20g. Features the Kaweco logo in matt silver metal on the end of the cap.

{"_id":{"$oid":"56d6aec426f1eb4c117c8603"},"title":"Pilot Justus 95 Adjustable Nib Fountain Pen","code":"PL29561","brand":"Pilot","price":249.98,"description":"A unique fountain pen with an adjustable nib that can be changed from hard to soft, altering how much the nib flexes with pressure.The Justus is made to Pilot's usual high standards - a beautifully-made pen that should work reliably for many, many years.  There's an old-fashioned simplicity to its design, with a subtle barleycorn pattern engraved into the black barrel, reminiscent of the chasing patterns commonly used on early black hard rubber pens; while the trim is gold-plated to match the 14ct gold nib.  It uses Pilot's IC-50 cartridges, and is supplied with the CON-70 button converter for a good ink capacity.  You'll need that capacity, because despite its understated good looks, this really is a pen to be used, not just left on a shelf and admired.One of the things people love about fountain pens is the variety of nibs, including nibs of different hardnesses.  A hard nib is one that doesn't flex when you press on a little more firmly, while a soft nib bends as you press harder, opening up the tines, and writing a wider line.  Much of the time, for most normal writing, a hard nib is good - they don't give much variation, but they're easier to write with, and more forgiving for those less used to fountain pens.  When you want a little more flair, you might prefer a softer nib that can actually show the extra force when you press on a bit harder, giving more expression to your writing.The Justus can be both hard and soft and anywhere in between.  Turn the dial behind the nib, and you can adjust its springiness, allowing the nib to respond (or not respond) to your writing style.As well as making for a more interesting writing experience, artists often use fountain pens with a bit of flex to the nib, as they allow for more expression when drawing.  Sometimes, though, they need a more predictable line width, and a soft nib becomes harder to use.  The Pilot Justus gets around this problem, as an artist can choose how much flexibility they want the nib to have to suit the moment.So it's very useful, but how does it work?  The nib itself is somewhat flexible.  It isn't as flexible as many vintage flexible nibs were, or as some dip-pen nibs, but it's what Pilot class as a 'soft' nib, similar to that of the Pilot Falcon.  On top of the nib is a metal bar, pressing down on the nib, holding it in place and preventing it from flexing.  When set to the 'hard' end of its adjustment, this bar is pushed forward, and holds the nib towards the tip, so it really can't move much at all.  At the 'soft' end, the bar is pulled back, and allows more of the nib to bend as you put some pressure on it.  Because the bar is visible, you can always see how the pen has been set when you pick it up.","category":"fountain-pens","__v":0}

It's an excellent conductor (not of music, it doesn't move enough for that), it can be alloyed with numerous other metals to great effect and is naturally biostatic (bacteria will not grow on it - very hygienic). It's rarely used for making pens though, which is strange because it looks amazing, is wonderfully tactile and will age and acquire a unique patina over time - in air untreated copper will slowly acquire a blue-green outer coating - think old copper pipes or the Statue of Liberty. If the pen is being used frequently, the patina will be a much darker coppery colour, as the blue-green coating will not have time to develop. Once the pen has developed this initial patina it will remain unchanged for a long time as it serves as a protective barrier to the copper underneath. The finish can either be left to develop its patina or can be restored using copper polish and a liberal application of elbow grease.Important note: As copper is a soft and malleable metal, the surface of the pen will pick up scratches and marks through use and transit. If you like to keep your pens looking pristine then this, coupled with the fact it'll develop a patina, means this isn't the pen for you.Milled from solid copper, which is left untreated and uncoated, it weighs in at 26g which is more than some pens twice its size.The Liliput Copper has inherited all of the great features from the original Liliput. It's super-compact at just 96mm long closed, the cap screws onto the end to create a pen 125mm long. Barrel diameter is 9.5mm, cap diameter is 10mm. The Kaweco logo is etched onto the top of the cap.Stainless-steel nib in extra-fine, fine, medium, broad or extra-broad.Uses short international standard cartridges.

The untreated finish means this pen will - like the Al-Sport Raw that came before it - wear over time and develop a unique patina depending on use and storage conditions. The finish can either be left to develop or can be restored using brass polish and a liberal application of elbow grease.The Brass Sport closely follows an original 1935 octagonal design.

The untreated finish means this pen will - like the Al-Sport Raw that came before it - wear over time and develop a unique patina depending on use and storage conditions. The finish can either be left to develop its patina or can be restored using brass polish and a liberal application of elbow grease.

It's strong, it's heavy and it looks and feels great. Lots of pens have brass barrels or components but the brass is normally hidden away under layers of paint or plastic. Not so with the Liliput Brass.Milled from solid brass, which is left untreated and uncoated, it weighs in at 24g which is more than some pens twice its size. The untreated finish means this pen will - like the Al-Sport Raw that came before it - wear over time and develop a unique patina depending on use and storage conditions. The finish can either be left to develop its patina or can be restored using brass polish and a liberal application of elbow grease. The Liliput Brass has inherited all of the great features from the original Liliput. It's super-compact at just 98mm long and 9mm in diameter. Push-button retract. The Kaweco logo is etched onto the top of the push-button.Smooth brass finish will develop a unique patina over time.

That's right, take a perfectly good pen and throw it in a giant industrial washing machine with a bunch of rocks. The result is a writing instrument that looks as though it has been well used over the years. Creating the finish in this way also means that no two pens are the same - the pen you buy will vary from the image above, perhaps by a little, maybe by a lot.This pen will arrive scratched and marked with a slightly rough feel to the finish; if you like to keep your pens pretty then this probably isn't one for you.Matt blue stonewash finish with polished stainless-steel nib.The AL Sport closely follows an original 1935 octagonal design - 'Small in the pocket, large in the hand'. The oversized cap arrangement creates a small closed pen but a full length open pen. Closed, the pen is just 108mm long, open 133mm long. The barrel is 14mm in diameter (around the cap).Pocket clips are optional, and not supplied with the pen. You can add the new deluxe pocket clip at extra cost.Made from tough, solid aluminium, weighing approx. 22g. Features the Kaweco logo on the end of the cap. Large-capacity rollerball refill - capless quality. Supplied as black medium tip.  Refill with Schmidt P8127M.Supplied in a Kaweco gift tin.","category":"rollerball-pens","__v":0}

Traditional fibre-tip drawing pens are great but the tips tend to change over time due to wear and pressure.  They also have a 'drag' to them which is either great feedback or irritating, depending on your preference.  Finally, they have a relatively short life as the ink supply is small.  Old-school steel-nib pens such as the rotring Isograph keep their line size, but are high-maintenance.  They're cheap to run on bottled ink, but expensive to buy in the first place.The Graphic Liner solves virtually all the problems of older pen types.  The tough rollerball tip is made from stainless-steel with a tungsten-carbide ball.  The hard-wearing materials ensure a stable line width throughout the life of the pen.  The smooth-running ball gives an exceptionally slick writing experience compared to old-style drawing pens.The Graphic Liner is a 'free-ink' pen - this means it has a hollow barrel with no fibre core - ensuring plenty of ink and consistent delivery until the last drop.Just like traditional drawing pens, the Graphic Liner contains waterproof, fadeproof pigment ink - a technology OHTO pioneered in the rollerball market.A tough polypropylene barrel and stainless-steel pocket clip complete the package.OHTO Graphic Liner is available with 6 different nib sizes.  These are marked to compare with traditional fibre-tip pens.  005 smallest, up to 10.  The actual rollerball tip sizes are as follows:\n005 = 0.3mm tip\n01 = 0.4mm\n02 = 0.5mm\n03 = 0.7mm\n05 = 1.0mm\n10 = 1.5mmWallet of 6 pens - one of each tip size.","category":"rollerball-pens","__v":0}

The premise is simple, take the popular AL Sport and stonewash it like you would a pair of jeans. That's right, take a perfectly good pen and throw it in a giant industrial washing machine with a bunch of rocks. The result is a writing instrument that looks as though it has been well used over the years. Creating the finish in this way also means that no two pens are the same - the pen you buy will vary from the image above, perhaps by a little, maybe by a lot.This pen will arrive scratched and marked with a slightly rough feel to the finish; if you like to keep your pens pretty then this probably isn't one for you.Matt black stonewash finish with polished stainless-steel nib.The AL Sport closely follows an original 1935 octagonal design - 'Small in the pocket, large in the hand'. The oversized cap arrangement creates a small closed pen but a full length open pen. Closed, the pen is just 108mm long, open 133mm long. The barrel is 14mm in diameter (around the cap).Pocket clips are optional, and not supplied with the pen. You can add the new deluxe pocket clip at extra cost.Made from tough, solid aluminium, weighing approx. 22g. Features the Kaweco logo on the end of the cap.

Because you're throwing less away each time you refill your pen, it's more cost-effective, and better for the environment.All the great features of the original V5 are still there - the fine needlepoint tip, the reliable V-System for controlling ink flow, the good looks, and ink 'windows' in the barrel, so you know how much ink you have left.0.5mm tip writes approximately 0.3mm line.As part of Pilot's BegreeN range of recycled pens, the body is made from 71% recycled plastic, and as an added bonus, it's supplied with three extra cartridges, free of charge.We experimented with using these pens with bottled ink, rather than using the cartridges - a bit of a risky and potentially messy way of filling them, but it was interesting to try!","category":"rollerball-pens","__v":0}

It's strong, it's heavy and looks and feels great. Lots of pens have brass barrels or components but the brass is normally hidden away under layers of paint or plastic. Not so with the Kaweco Brass Sport.Made from solid lead-free 'eco' brass, which is left untreated and uncoated, it weighs in at 46g which is more than most other pens currently available. The untreated finish means this pen will - like the Al-Sport Raw that came before it - wear over time and develop a unique patina depending on use and storage conditions. The finish can either be left to develop or can be restored using brass polish and a liberal application of elbow grease.The Brass Sport closely follows an original 1935 octagonal design - 'Small in the pocket, large in the hand'. The oversized cap arrangement creates a small closed pen but a full length open pen. Closed, the pen is just 108mm long, open 133mm long.

Also suitable for detailed illustration, graphs and drawings. The 0.4mm rollerball writes a 0.2mm line of pure vivid gel colour without spreading - thanks to the high-tech bio-polymer ink. Available in ten colours. All that - wrapped up in a good-looking crystal-clear barrel and the four best-selling colours are refillable!Uses our customers tell us about include writing in diaries and journals; accounting; editing and proof-reading; annotations, especially bibles; cricket scoring; correcting navigation charts; filling out forms; and er.. marking up acupuncture.The G-Tec-C4 also goes by the name Hi-Tec-C in certain other markets - same pen, same ink.The production of a 0.4mm ball point tip has been achieved using the 3-dimples supporting system technology. In this system, the 0.4mm carbide alloy ball is mounted by making three depressions in the tip of a fine stainless steel pipe, in contrast to the traditional system of hollowing out the metal tip. Since the ball will be supported on 'points' the reduction in wear surface allows smoother rotation. The resulting stroke width is just 0.2mm.The ink used in the G-Tec-C4 is a bio-polymer ink that uses a resin made from a micro-organism very similar to yeast. Although this ink is in a highly viscous gel form during storage, the ink viscosity reduces during the writing process due to the action of the ball rotation. The ink immediately becomes viscous again once on the paper - this special characteristic allowing a clear line without ink spreading.","category":"rollerball-pens","__v":0}
